Since Visual Studio communicates with ASEBA through the asebacmd client, which connects with asebaswitch. The original
windows ASEBA installer generates constant errors when this is done.

Because of this it is necessary to use a re compiled modified version of ASEBA, available at:

	"UsersPath"\Swiss Thesis\CoreRobot\ASEBA\ASEBA External Interfaces\ASEBAExt Code\asebaMYbuild\aseba

PD: an easy way to execute it is thorugh the command line (cmd):

	cd "UsersPath\asebaMYbuild\asebaEXE" && asebastudio && asebaswitch -p 33333 ser:port= "EpucksPortXXXX"
